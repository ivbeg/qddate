# Installation

At the command line:

```bash
pip install qddate
```

If you do not have `pip`, you can fall back to `easy_install`:

```bash
easy_install qddate
```

To install from the latest sources:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ivbeg/qddate.git
cd qddate
python setup.py install
```

## Dependencies

You can also download [pyparsing](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyparsing) as a source distribution or wheel and install it alongside qddate using the same commands shown above.
